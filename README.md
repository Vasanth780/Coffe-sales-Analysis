**Introduction**
This project analyzes coffee sales data, cleans and prepares the data, performs exploratory analysis, and finally builds a simple linear regression model to predict sales. The objective is to uncover trends and understand the factors affecting sales.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset includes coffee sales transactions with the following columns:

date: The transaction date.
datetime: Full timestamp of the transaction.
cash_type: Payment method (e.g., card).
card: An anonymized identifier for the payment card.
money: Amount spent in the transaction (target variable).
coffee_name: The type of coffee purchased.

**Setup**

**Clone the repository:**

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Vasanth780
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd coffee-sales-analysis
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Place the coffee_sales.csv file in the project directory.

**Run the Python script to execute the analysis:
**
bash
Copy code
python coffee_sales_analysis.py
Data Preparation and Cleaning

**Handling Missing Values:**

Missing numerical values (money) are filled using the median value.
Categorical values (coffee_name) are filled with the most frequent (mode) value.
Converting Data Types:

The date column is converted to a datetime format to allow for time-based operations.

**Removing Outliers:**

Outliers in the numerical columns (money) are removed using Z-scores with a threshold of 3 standard deviations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations are generated to uncover patterns and insights:

**Sales Over Time:**

A line plot showing how sales vary over different months of the year.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=data, x='Month', y='money', hue='Year')
plt.title('Monthly Sales Over Years')
plt.show()
Sales by Coffee Type:

A bar plot that visualizes which coffee types contribute the most to sales.
Example Code:

python
Copy code
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(data=data, x='coffee_name', y='money')
plt.title('Sales by Coffee Type')
plt.show()

**Machine Learning Modeling**

**Feature Engineering**

Extract the month and year from the date column and use them as features.
Drop the original date column after extraction.

**Splitting the Data**

The dataset is split into training and testing sets:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = data.drop(columns=['money'])
y = data['money']

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Training the Model
A simple linear regression model is trained on the dataset:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Initialize and train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
print(f'R^2 Score: {r2}')

**Model Interpretation**
You can interpret the model by looking at the coefficients for each feature:

python
Copy code
coefficients = pd.DataFrame(model.coef_, X.columns, columns=['Coefficient'])
print(coefficients)
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the full pipeline from data cleaning and feature engineering to building and evaluating a machine learning model for sales prediction. The analysis highlights key factors influencing coffee sales and offers insights for further business decision-making.
